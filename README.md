# PyProjects
Random Python projects as I learn how to write and debug code. 

The first uploaded project is a simple BMI calculator with a bit of personality.
  - If you are like me and use freedom units (imperial system), have no fear; the wizard can use its powers to conjure the info in the form it needs. 
  - However, if you commonly use the metric system, you will answer the questions and enjoy my humor as the wizard 'magically' knows what you just told it.

  - After answering all of the questions, LIKE MAGIC! You will be told your BMI!
