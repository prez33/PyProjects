# PyProjects
Random Python projects as I learn how to write and debug code.

# Band Name Generator
This introductory project uses basic information about the user to generate a potential band name.

# BMI Wizard
This project is a simple BMI calculator with a bit of personality.
  - If you are like me and use freedom units (imperial system), have no fear; the wizard can use its powers to conjure the info in the form it needs. 
  - However, if you commonly use the metric system, you will answer the questions and enjoy my humor as the wizard 'magically' knows what you just told it.

  - After answering all of the questions, LIKE MAGIC! You will be told your BMI!

# Tip Calculator
This project uses concepts similar to the BMI Wizard's to calculate the tip and total amount owed. 

- The number of people splitting the check refers to those in addition to the user

# Choose Your Adventure 
Fun little, choose your adventure based on a TV show. 
  - There are no hints
  - The only way to move on is to answer correctly
  - There is a bonus loop and an alternate ending if you answer in certain ways.
HAVE FUN!

# Odd or Even
This is a simple program to check if a number is odd or even
  - Using the modulo, the program calculates if there is a remainder of 0 after dividing the input by 2

# To Leap Year or Not to Leap Year
This is from day 3 of working with if/else statements. In the course, they use it as a nested loop, but I wanted to try to achieve the same result without copying. 
  - I also wanted to make the program with fewer lines of code. 
  - The divisible by 4 but not by 100 was a confusing condition in the prompt, as 100 itself is divisible by 4, and leap years are every 4 years.
