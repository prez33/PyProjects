# PyProjects
Random Python projects as I learn how to write and debug code. 

# Band Name Generator
This introductory project uses basic information about the user to generate a potential band name. 

# BMI Wizard
This project is a simple BMI calculator with a bit of personality.
  - If you are like me and use freedom units (imperial system), have no fear; the wizard can use its powers to conjure the info in the form it needs. 
  - However, if you commonly use the metric system, you will answer the questions and enjoy my humor as the wizard 'magically' knows what you just told it.

  - After answering all of the questions, LIKE MAGIC! You will be told your BMI!

# Tip Calculator
This project uses concepts similar to the BMI Wizard's to calculate the tip and total amount owed. 

- The number of people splitting the check refers to those in addition to the user
